      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro"> I am a user experience design student, with a background in Politics and service, based in the Philadelphia area.
      Coming from a political and service background you may be thinking "why UX/UI design?" Well, that is an excellent question!
      While studying politics I noticed that my passion for research and design continued to grow as my desire to continue in the politic
      field continued to deminish. After doing some extensitve research, I found that UX/UI design would be a good fit for me. Soon after, I
      enrolled into a boot camp and the rest is history.</p>
